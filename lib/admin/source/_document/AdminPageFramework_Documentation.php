/**
 * Handles creation of admin pages and setting forms.
 * 
 * This class should be extended and the `setUp()` method should be overridden to define how pages are composed.
 * Most of the internal methods are prefixed with the underscore like `_getSomething()` and callback methods are prefixed with <code>_reply</code>.
 * The methods for the users are public and do not have those prefixes.
 * 
 * <h2>Hooks</h2>
 * <p>The class automatically creates WordPress action and filter hooks associated with the class methods.
 * The class methods corresponding to the name of the below actions and filters can be extended to modify the page output. Those methods are the callbacks of the filters and the actions.</p>
 * <h3>Methods and Action Hooks</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>**start_{instantiated class name}** – triggered at the end of the class constructor. This will be triggered in any admin page except admin-ajax.php. The class object will be passed to the first parameter [3.1.3+].</li>
 *     <li>**set_up_{instantiated class name}** – [3.1.3+] triggered after the setUp() method is called. The class object will be passed to the first parameter.</li>
 *     <li>**load_{instantiated class name}** – [2.1.0+] triggered when the framework's page is loaded before the header gets sent. This will not be triggered in the admin pages that are not registered by the framework. The first parameter: class object [3.1.2+].</li>
 *     <li>**load_{page slug}** – [2.1.0+] triggered when the framework's page is loaded before the header gets sent. This will not be triggered in the admin pages that are not registered by the framework. The first parameter: class object [3.1.2+].</li>

 * <h3>Remarks</h3>
 * <p>The slugs must not contain a dot(.) or a hyphen(-) since it is used in the callback method name.</p>
 * <h3>Examples</h3>
 * <p>If the instantiated class name is Sample_Admin_Pages, defining the following class method will embed a banner image in all pages created by the class.</p>
 * <code>class Sample_Admin_Pages extends AdminPageFramework {
 * ...
 *     function content_top_Sample_Admin_Pages( $sContent ) {
 *         return '<div style="float:right;"><img src="' . plugins_url( 'img/banner468x60.gif', __FILE__ ) . '" /></div>' 
 *             . $sContent;
 *     }
 * ...
 * }</code>
 * <p>If the created page slug is my_first_setting_page, defining the following class method will filter the middle part of the page output.</p>
 * <code>class Sample_Admin_Pages extends AdminPageFramework {
 * ...
 *     function content_my_first_setting_page( $sContent ) {
 *         return $sContent . '<p>Hello world!</p>';
 *     }
 * ...
 * }</code>
